**Functional Requirements**
* 5 points - Uses data from at least two different sources: local file, internet, web service, relational database, AWS S3, etc; and formats: CSV, JSON, database, XML, Excel, etc
* 5 points - Data from multiple sources has to be joined together at least twice
* 5 points - Data is aggregated or pivoted at least twice during the program
* 5 points - Some kind of field-level transformation is performed at least 5 times
* 5 points - The program creates 3 or more data visualizations 
* 5 points - The program serves a theoretical purpose described in documentation, that could potentially do something in healthcare or another industry of interest

**Modularity / Style**
* 15 points - The code is broken up into various functions or classes to make testing and reuse easier

**Documentation and Professionalism**
* 15 points - All functions are documented and notebook cells include annotations and explanations.

**(-1) Generic variable names like `data1` or `data2` are not acceptable.  They make it hard for the reader to understand what is going on and what this variable refers to.**

**Your documentation for the rename_column function is correct.  It returns a dataframe, not an int**

**Very nice work overall**
